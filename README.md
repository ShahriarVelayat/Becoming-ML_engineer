# Becoming-ML_engineer
This repository documents my journey to become a Machine Learning Engineer. It contains the list of projects undertaken, books read, courses pursued and almost everything I did in the process. So follow along or diverge to you own path, each way, I believe this will add value to any data professional / enthusiast.

# Projects Undertaken
* Finding Patterns in chaos - Determining items that sell together using [Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/manvimadan12/Market-Basket-Analysis)
