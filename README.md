# Becoming-ML_engineer
This repository documents my journey to become a Machine Learning Engineer. It contains the list of projects undertaken, books read, courses pursued and almost everything I did in the process. So follow along or diverge to you own path, each way, I believe this will add value to any data professional / enthusiast.

# Projects Undertaken
* Finding Patterns in chaos - Determining items that sell together using [Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/manvimadan12/Market-Basket-Analysis) 
* Predicting the customers that are prone to leave us from those that are loyal - [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/manvimadan12/Customer-Churn-Prediction)
* Is that msuhroom safe to eat? - [Mushroom Classification](https://github.com/manvimadan12/Mushroom-Classification)
* Optimising our ad selection strategy using Reinforcement Learning - [Ads Optimisation](https://github.com/manvimadan12/Ads-Optimisation)

# 100daysofmlcode
They say that the process has to be more fun than the journey. So, I decided to dicument everything while having all that fun. Find my learning from each day when I took #100daysofmlcode challenge here: [@ml.newzealand](https://www.instagram.com/ml.newzealand/)
